Synopsis
========

In this project I investigate the exponential distribution in R and
compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.

The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda)
where lambda is the rate parameter.

The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard
deviation is also 1/lambda.

For this project:

-   Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations.

-   Investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials.

-   We need to do a thousand simulations.

-   Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the
    properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.

I should:

-   Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of
    the distribution.

-   Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the
    theoretical variance of the distribution.

-   Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

Simulation of an Exponential Distribution
=========================================

I calculated the average of 40 samples drawn from the exponential
distribution a thousand times

    set.seed(1000)

    # set lambda 
    lambda <- 0.2

    # samples
    n <- 40

    # simulations
    NSim <- 1000

    # simulate
    simExp <- replicate(NSim, rexp(n, lambda))

Calculate mean of exponentials
==============================

    meanExp <- apply(simExp, 2, mean)

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution
==================================================================================

    # Simulated mean
    smean <- mean(meanExp)
    print(smean)

    ## [1] 4.986963

    # Theoretical mean
    tmean <- 1/lambda
    print(tmean)

    ## [1] 5

    means <- cumsum(meanExp)/1:NSim

    # Construction plot

    library(ggplot2)
    g <- ggplot(data.frame(y=means, x=1:NSim), aes(x=x, y=y ))+
         geom_hline(yintercept = tmean, color = "red", size = 2)+
         geom_line(size=1, color = "blue")+ 
         labs(title="Distribution sample means of 1000 Samples",x = "Means", y="NÂ° simulations")
    print(g)

We can see that simulated mean is very close to theoretical mean.

2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
=================================================================================================================

    # standard deviation and variance of distribution of averages of 40 exponentials

    sdSim <-sd(meanExp)
    print(sdSim)

    ## [1] 0.8089147

    varSim <-  sdSim^2
    print(varSim)

    ## [1] 0.654343

    # theoretical standard deviation and variance

    Thsd <-(1/lambda)/sqrt(n)
    print(Thsd)

    ## [1] 0.7905694

    varTh <- Thsd^2
    print(varTh)

    ## [1] 0.625

The simulated standard deviation and variance are closed to theoretical
standard deviation and variance.

3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
======================================================

1. Plot of distrubution simulated means.
----------------------------------------

    data <- data.frame(meanExp, 1:NSim)
    ggplot(data.frame(y=meanExp), aes(x=y)) + 
       geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth=0.1, fill="pink", 
                      color="darkblue") +
       stat_function(fun=dnorm, args = list(mean=smean, 
                                         sd=sdSim), color = "darkred",
                     size=1) +
       labs(title="Distribution of averages of 1000 samples", x="Simulation Means")

2. Compare our distribution with normal distribution.
-----------------------------------------------------

    qqnorm(meanExp, col="5"); qqline(meanExp, col="2")

This plots show us that distribution of simulated mean is approximately
normal.
